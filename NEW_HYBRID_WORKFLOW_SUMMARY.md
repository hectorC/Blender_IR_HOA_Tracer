## New Hybrid Workflow Implementation Complete

### What Was Implemented

The new hybrid workflow has been successfully added to the `AIRT_OT_RenderIR` class in `ir_raytracer/ui/operators.py`. This implements the user's requested workflow:

### New Workflow Steps

1. **Separate Forward/Reverse Generation**: Generate standard forward and reverse tracer IRs independently
2. **Individual Post-Processing**: Apply direct impulse removal and normalization to each IR separately  
3. **Crossfading**: Blend the processed IRs with time-based weighting
4. **Final Output**: Apply final normalization and save

### New Methods Added

#### `_trace_new_hybrid(self, context, sources, receivers, bvh, obj_map)`
Main method that orchestrates the new workflow:
- Creates `RayTracingConfig` from scene parameters
- Calls `ForwardRayTracer.trace()` and `ReverseRayTracer.trace()` separately
- Applies post-processing to both IRs individually
- Calls crossfading method to blend results
- Returns final hybrid IR

#### `_crossfade_hybrid_irs(self, forward_ir, reverse_ir, sample_rate)`
Implements time-based crossfading:
- **Early period (0-50ms)**: 100% forward, 0% reverse
- **Transition (50-200ms)**: Smooth linear crossfade
- **Late period (200ms+)**: 0% forward, 100% reverse
- Ensures weight normalization (weights always sum to 1.0)

### Integration Points

- **Dispatch Logic**: Modified the main `execute()` method to call `_trace_new_hybrid()` when `airt_tracer_method == 'HYBRID'`
- **Existing Features**: Leverages existing `_remove_direct_impulse()` method and normalization code
- **Scene Parameters**: Uses all existing Blender scene properties (sample rate, ray count, etc.)

### Key Benefits

1. **Clean Separation**: Forward and reverse tracers run independently, eliminating blending artifacts
2. **Individual Control**: Each tracer can be post-processed separately before combination
3. **Smooth Transitions**: Time-based crossfading provides natural earlyâ†’late energy transition
4. **Preservation**: Maintains all existing features (normalization, direct removal, file export)
5. **Physics-Based**: Forward dominates early reflections, reverse handles late reverberation

### Testing Completed

- **Crossfade Logic**: Verified smooth transitions and weight normalization
- **Method Structure**: Confirmed all method signatures and logic flow
- **Syntax Validation**: Python compilation successful, no syntax errors

### Usage

The new workflow is automatically used when:
- User selects "Hybrid" as the tracer method in Blender UI
- All existing UI controls work (direct removal, normalization, export settings)
- Output files follow existing naming conventions

This implementation provides the clean, controllable hybrid processing the user requested while maintaining full compatibility with the existing addon interface.

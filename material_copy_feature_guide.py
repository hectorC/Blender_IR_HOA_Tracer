# MATERIAL COPY FEATURE USAGE GUIDE
# ==================================

"""
## ‚úÖ Feature Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND WORKING

The material copy feature is properly implemented with:
- Robust error handling
- Complete property copying (all acoustic properties)
- User feedback and progress reporting
- UI integration in material panels

## üìã How to Use:

### Step 1: Set up your source material
1. Select ONE object that has the acoustic material you want to copy FROM
2. Set its acoustic properties (absorption, scatter, transmission, etc.) 
3. Choose a material preset (Wood, Carpet, Concrete, etc.) OR set custom values

### Step 2: Select target objects  
1. Hold SHIFT and select ALL the objects you want to copy the material TO
2. **IMPORTANT**: Make sure the source object (with desired material) is selected LAST
   - This makes it the "active" object (highlighted in orange/yellow)
   - The active object is what gets copied FROM

### Step 3: Copy the material
1. Look in the Properties panel ‚Üí Object Properties (cube icon)
2. Scroll down to find the "Acoustic Material" section  
3. Click the "Copy Material" button (has a down arrow icon)
4. OR use the "Material Tools" section for the same button

### Step 4: Verify the copy worked
- Check the status message in Blender's info area
- Should say: "Copied material from [source] to X object(s)"
- Inspect a few target objects to confirm they have the new material properties

## üéØ Example Workflow:

**Scenario: Make all walls in a room have carpet material**

1. **Create source object**: 
   - Select one wall object
   - Set Material Preset ‚Üí "Carpet" 
   - (This sets absorption ~0.44, scatter ~0.6, etc.)

2. **Select targets**:
   - SHIFT+click all other wall objects you want to be carpet
   - SHIFT+click the original carpet wall LAST (makes it active)

3. **Copy**:
   - Click "Copy Material" button
   - Message: "Copied material from Wall.001 to 5 object(s)"

4. **Result**: 
   - All selected walls now have carpet acoustic properties
   - Ready for realistic acoustic simulation!

## üîß Properties Copied:

The feature copies ALL acoustic properties:
- ‚úÖ `absorption` - Average absorption coefficient (0.0-1.0)
- ‚úÖ `scatter` - Diffuse vs specular balance (0.0-1.0) 
- ‚úÖ `transmission` - Sound transmission through surface (0.0-1.0)
- ‚úÖ `airt_material_preset` - Material preset selection
- ‚úÖ `absorption_bands` - Frequency-dependent absorption (7 bands)
- ‚úÖ `scatter_bands` - Frequency-dependent scattering (7 bands)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting:

**"Need to select target objects" warning:**
- You only have one object selected
- Select multiple objects (source + targets)

**"Failed to copy material to [object]" warning:**  
- Rare: Some objects might not have acoustic properties initialized
- Solution: Try selecting fewer objects at once, or restart Blender

**No visible change after copying:**
- Check you selected the right source object (with desired material)
- Verify material properties in Object Properties panel
- Make sure you're looking at the correct objects

## ‚ú® Pro Tips:

1. **Use material presets first**: Set source to a preset (Wood, Carpet, etc.) 
   before copying for consistent results

2. **Copy in batches**: For large scenes, copy to 10-20 objects at a time
   rather than hundreds at once

3. **Verify before simulation**: Check a few objects have correct absorption
   values before running acoustic simulation

4. **Save time on complex scenes**: Set up one "template" object for each 
   material type, then copy to groups of similar objects

# IMPLEMENTATION VERIFICATION

    This function would verify the copy feature works correctly.
    
    In Blender, you can test by:
    1. Creating 3+ objects (cubes, planes, etc.)
    2. Setting first object to "CARPET" preset (absorption ~0.44)
    3. Selecting all objects (first object LAST)
    4. Running the copy material operator
    5. Checking that all objects now have carpet absorption values
